    "The Collatz Conjecture is an [slightly head-melting](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/collatz_conjecture.png) unsolved problem in mathematics, which posits that if you repeatedly apply a simple set of rules to a positive integer, you will eventually reach the number 1. If the previous integer is even, the next integer is half of the previous integer. It it's odd, the next integer is three times the previous plus one. The conjecture is that you will always reach number 1. The formula for the conjecture is:\n",

    "The first challenge here is to understand the problem before implementing it in code. In a previous module, I had learned about some of the theory behind the conjecture from [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg&t=1s&ab_channel=Veritasium), and had researched how a sequence of calculations could best be done in Python. [This article in medium](https://medium.com/the-art-of-python/the-collatz-sequence-in-python-eb7e1f1b4f9e) was useful as was [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-print-collatz-sequence/).\n",
